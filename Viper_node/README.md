The documentation will guide you through the installation of a new DYM node. It covers both scenarios: setting up a DYM node alongside an existing Viper node and setting up a separate VPS for the DYM node


**Join DYM discord**

```

**Hardware for DYM node**

```
Dual Core
At least 100GB of SSD disk storage
At least 16GB of memory (RAM)
At least 100mbps network bandwidth

roller config init --interactive
```
**Select your network**
```
Select your network: Froopyland
Select your execution environment: EVM
Specify your RollApp denom: Name options (You should choose a personal name to avoid duplicates)
Set the genesis token supply: Enter for default

``
**Register DAPP**
``
roller tx register
``
it should return
``
Rollapp '<rollapp-id>' has been successfully registered on the hub.

Running node
roller run
For someone run the node in seperate vps please skip task below and go ahead to #checking DYM node running task

For someone run the DYM node in the same VPS with Viper, let's continue. Remember stop the node by run ctrl +c

Update relayer
Update configuration
Edit the ~/.roller/relayer/config/config.yaml

nano ~/.roller/relayer/config/config.yaml
Find and replace:

min-loop-duration: 0ms -> min-loop-duration: 100ms

rule: "" -> rule: "allowlist"

channel-list: [] -> channel-list: ["channel-0", "channel-49"]

Update binary
wget https://github.com/dymensionxyz/go-relayer/releases/download/v0.3.1-v2.5.2-relayer/Cosmos.Relayer_0.3.1-v2.5.2-relayer_linux_amd64.tar.gz

tar -xvf Cosmos.Relayer_0.3.1-v2.5.2-relayer_linux_amd64.tar.gz

mv Cosmos\ Relayer_0.3.1-v2.5.2-relayer_linux_amd64/rly /usr/local/bin/roller_bins/
Then running again

Encounter with bug1:
alt text

the DYM and Viper node is conflicting the port. There are 2 ports that need to changes 26656 and 26657

Change for 26657
roller config set rollapp-rpc-port 6969
Change for 26656
Open the file ~/.roller/rollapp/config/config.toml and find if there are any port number 26656, please change to any port.

nano ~/.roller/rollapp/config/config.toml
Encounter with bug2
alt text

You catched the bug because your light client is mapping wrong port

Run cmd:

roller config set lc-rpc-port 26658
ufw configuration
sudo ufw allow 6969
sudo ufw allow 8545
sudo ufw allow 1317
sudo ufw allow 26658
Checking DYM node running
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
     http://<your_node_ip>:<your_node_port>
replace http://<your_node_ip>:<your_DYM_node_port>

if the node responds,

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"xxxxx"}

this will confirm ur node is working

Update blockchain.json file
nano ~/.viper/config/blockchains.json
copy and paste:

[
  {
    "id": "0001",
    "url": "http://localhost:8082/",
    "basic_auth": {
      "username": "",
      "password": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "0002",
    "url": "http://your-ip:8545",
    "basic_auth": {
      "username": "",
      "password": ""
    }
  }
]
if you are runnin dym in seperate, replace your-ip with your VPS IP.

If you are running in the same VPS, replease your-ip to localhost

Staking
Rerun Stake Command:

viper servicers stake self <addr> <amt> 0001,0002 $GEO-ID <viper node URL> testnet
The viper node URL is the URL you previously used while staking; https://$HOSTNAME:443

Replace $GEO-ID with your geographical region ID. Consider using main region IDs such as:

0A00: North America
0B00: South America
0C00: Europe
0D00: Asia-Pacific
0E00: Middle East & Africa
If you had staked with a sub-region geo ID earlier, you can check and update it by running

cat ~/.viper/config/geozone.json
Noted: please query your viper validation and take amount the same with current amount as shown in screenshot. alt text

After running stake, wait for 1 blocks and check your validation again. If you got this, you are success. alt text

Then, restart your viper node

sudo systemctl restart viper.service
Additionall
Because the DYM node will close when you close terminal session. to keep the section remaining. Please using tmux or screen.
