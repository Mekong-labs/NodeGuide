## Uniswap just dropped Unichain, and this brings a new airdrop opportunity

## The first $UNI airdrop was huge, but there's still 45% left to be distributed

## This means we should definitely keep our eyes on Unichain:

- Bridge to Unichain
- Deploy a token
- Run a Node

## 1. Bridge ETH to Unichain and Make some swaps on Testnet

â–¸ Get some ETH on Sepolia
âœ¦ Sepolia Faucets: https://docs.scroll.io/en/user-guide/faucet/

â–¸ Bridge ETH from Sepolia to Unichain: https://superbridge.app/unichain-sepolia

â–¸ Make some swaps on Uniswap (Testnet mode): https://app.uniswap.org

## 2. Deploy an ERC20 token on Unichain

â€¢ You can easily do a one-click deployment with 
@Owlto_Finance
: https://owlto.finance/deploy?chain=Unichain

â€¢ Or, you can use @thirdweb


â–¸ Go to https://thirdweb.com, connect your wallet, and sign up
â–¸ Go to the "Contracts" tab and hit "Deploy"
â–¸ Click "Ready to Deploy" and choose one (I picked token)
â–¸ After setting the name, ticker, and other stuff, just deploy it

ðŸ“ŒYou can also deploy ERC721 or other types. Just select the other options after clicking "Ready to Deploy

## 3. Being a $SUI staker sets you apart from the others

It's been made clear: to become a validator on Unichain, stake $SUI on Ethereum mainnet

If you're aiming to benefit from a potential airdrop, I think this step is key

## 4. Run a Node (Optional)

Not guaranteed rewards

ðŸ“Œ Rent a VPS

â–¸ Go to https://contabo.com/en/vps/ sign up, and rent the second VPS (CLOUD VPS 2)

â–¸ I will run it for a few months so I bought it monthly, there will be a one time set-up fee

Select:
-European Union
-400 GB SSD
-Ubuntu 22.04
-Set your password and note it

â–¸ Do not change any other settings and complete the purchase

â–¸ Your node information will be sent to you via e-mail shortly

You don't have to use Contabo. You can rent VPS from another platform. If there is a cheaper one, write it in the comments

## 5. Go to https://github.com/Luthenn/Unichain-Node and paste the commands into your VPS one by one to run the node

At step 7, just copy the RPC links I mentioned and replace them. Thatâ€™s all you need to do there.
